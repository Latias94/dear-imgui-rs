# Changelog

All notable changes to `dear-imgui-glow` will be documented in this file.

The format follows Keep a Changelog and Semantic Versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `update_texture_with_context` now updates the GL texture already registered for an existing
  `TextureId` instead of creating or replacing a separate texture mapping.
- `Alpha8` texture creation and updates now use the same RGBA expansion path, matching the
  renderer's shader expectations.
- `GlowRenderer::destroy()` now clears renderer-owned multi-viewport state so callbacks become
  no-op when the renderer is destroyed before full platform shutdown.

## [0.10.4] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- Add a runnable `glow_external_context_regression` example that exercises `GlowRenderer::with_external_context()` together with Dear ImGui managed texture create/update/destroy requests.

### Fixed

- Make `render_with_context()` honor the caller-provided GL context for managed texture create/update/destroy requests instead of assuming the renderer owns a context internally. Fixes #22, thanks @CoffeeCatRailway.
- Add `register_texture_with_context()` / `update_texture_with_context()` helpers for applications that keep OpenGL context ownership outside `GlowRenderer`.
